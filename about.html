        <h2>What is the Angry Goose?</h2>
        <blockquote>We are a trading card and hobby shop that seeks to be Saipan's Number 1 stop for tournaments and gatherings. We currently
            only supply and support Magic: The Gathering, as they currently are the biggest TCG community on the island. However, we hope to serve
            other TCGs in the future!
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Why the Angry Goose?</h2>
        <blockquote>The story goes back to when I was in Virginia Beach. One of the first rules was absolutely DO NOT mess with the Geese (Gooses?)
            Why? The entire park where we trained in was their territory and if they caught you... They would honk, bite, and chase you until you left.
            I was taught to NEVER mess with an Angry Goose.
